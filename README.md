### Team Members

### Project Description
It is a simple sleep detecting project that detects your eyes and ask some silly questions and find out if you are actually awake or not. The responce of the website depends on if your answer is correct and also if your eyes are open or closed.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Some people always wonder if they are actually awake or not.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Orakkam Ahno Mwonu helps people find out that if they are actually awake by asking some questions and determine if they are awake or sleeping.
